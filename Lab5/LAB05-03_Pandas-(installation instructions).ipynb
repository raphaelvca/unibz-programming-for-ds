Like NumPy, Pandas vectorises most of the basic operations and strives to excute multiple operations in parallel, even on a single CPU, resulting in faster computation.<br>\n",

    "- Python version 2.6-2.7 or 3.3-3.5\n",
    "- Pandas version 0.18.0 or later: http://pandas.pydata.org/\n",
    "- Numpy version 1.7 or later: http://www.numpy.org/\n",
    "- matplotlib version 1.3 or later: http://matplotlib.org/\n",
    "- ipython version 3.x with notebook support, or ipython 4.x combined with jupyter: http://ipython.org\n",
    "- seaborn (this is used for some statistical data visualizations): http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/\n",
