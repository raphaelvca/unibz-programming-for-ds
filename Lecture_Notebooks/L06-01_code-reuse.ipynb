    "===\n",
    "One of the most important goals of the object-oriented approach to programming is the creation of **stable, reliable, reusable code**. If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code. In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can **inherit** from another class.<br>\n",
    "This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can **add any new attributes or behavior** that are appropriate. The original class is called the **parent** class, and the new class is a **child** of the parent class. The parent class is also called a **superclass**, and the child class is also called a **subclass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child class inherits all attributes and behavior from the parent class, but **any attributes that are defined *only* in the child class** are not available to the parent class. This may be obvious to many people, but it is worth stating. This also means **a child class can override behavior of the parent class**. If a child class defines a method that also appears in the parent class, objects of the child class will use the new method rather than the parent class method.\n",
